### **Personal Finance Dashboard Project Summary**

#### **Overview**:
The **Personal Finance Dashboard** is a full-stack web application designed to help users track their financial transactions, set budgets, analyze spending patterns, and predict future spending trends using data analysis and machine learning models.

The application integrates various technologies to offer a comprehensive solution for personal finance management. The main functionalities include user authentication, transaction management, budgeting, and machine learning-driven insights.

#### **Technologies Used**:
- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating the user interface.
  - **AngularJS**: For building dynamic and responsive frontend features like displaying data, forms, and charts.
  - **Chart.js**: For visualizing financial data such as income, expenses, and budgets in the form of bar charts, pie charts, etc.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
  - **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs and handling requests.
  - **MySQL**: Database to store user data, transactions, budgets, and other necessary information.
  - **Python**: Used for performing data analysis and machine learning tasks.

- **Machine Learning**:
  - **Prophet** (for time-series forecasting): Used to predict future spending patterns based on historical transaction data.
  - **K-means Clustering**: Optional feature for segmenting spending categories.

#### **Key Features**:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Users can sign up, log in, and manage their session securely.
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for session management to ensure that users remain logged in as they navigate the app.

2. **Dashboard for Tracking Finances**:
   - The main dashboard displays a summary of income, expenses, and savings for a selected period (monthly, weekly).
   - **Charts**: Various visualizations (bar charts, pie charts) are provided to help users understand their spending trends by category and over time.

3. **Transaction and Budget Management**:
   - Users can add, update, and delete transactions, specifying the category (e.g., groceries, entertainment, etc.), amount, and type (income or expense).
   - Users can set budgets for each category and monitor their progress in real-time.
   - **Alerts**: The system sends notifications when a user is nearing or exceeding their budget limit for a specific category.

4. **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Transaction data is aggregated by date, category, and type (income/expense). Monthly or weekly totals are calculated for better financial analysis.
   - **Predictive Analytics**: The app uses time-series models (Prophet) to forecast future spending patterns based on historical data.
   - **Budget Depletion Alerts**: Notifies users when they are close to exceeding their budget in any category.
   - **Category Analysis**: Provides insights into spending patterns and identifies categories where users are spending more than average, offering opportunities for savings.

#### **How it Works**:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - When a user visits the website, they are presented with a login page. After signing up or logging in, users gain access to their personal dashboard.

2. **Adding Transactions**:
   - Users can manually add transactions (income or expense) and categorize them (e.g., groceries, rent, salary).
   - The data is stored in the MySQL database and updated in real-time.

3. **Budget Tracking**:
   - Users can set budgets for different categories.
   - The system compares real-time spending with the set budget and visualizes how much has been spent in each category.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Charts like bar and pie charts help users see their income vs. expenses, trends over time, and budget usage.

5. **Machine Learning Predictions**:
   - The Python backend performs predictive analysis on historical transaction data using machine learning models (e.g., Prophet for time-series forecasting).
   - The model provides future spending predictions and budget alerts to help users manage their finances more effectively.

6. **Backend Integration**:
   - The Node.js backend handles routing for authentication, transaction management, and budget monitoring. The Python scripts for data analysis and machine learning are executed as needed, and their results are sent to the frontend for display.

7. **Frontend**:
   - The AngularJS frontend communicates with the backend APIs and displays data, charts, and alerts to the user.

#### **Setup and Installation**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For the **frontend**:
     Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the **backend**:
     Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `personal_finance_dashboard`.
   - Use the provided SQL schema to create the necessary tables (users, transactions, budgets).
   - Make sure the database credentials are configured correctly in the backend.

4. **Python Setup**:
   - Install the required Python libraries for data analysis:
     ```bash
     pip install prophet pandas
     ```

5. **Start the Server**:
   - To start the backend server, run:
     ```bash
     node backend/server.js
     ```
   - To run the data analysis and machine learning scripts, run:
     ```bash
     python data_analysis/analysis.py
     ```

6. **Access the Frontend**:
   - After starting the backend, open the frontend (AngularJS app) in the browser:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

#### **Testing**:

- **Test the API**: You can use Postman or any other tool to test the backend API endpoints like `/api/auth`, `/api/transactions`, etc.
- **Frontend Testing**: Test the features such as login, adding transactions, setting budgets, and viewing charts.

#### **Future Enhancements**:
- Add more advanced financial insights and reports.
- Implement a mobile app version of the dashboard.
- Add more machine learning algorithms to provide even more accurate predictions and suggestions for users.

#### **Conclusion**:
This Personal Finance Dashboard allows users to effectively manage their finances by tracking transactions, monitoring budgets, and providing predictions using machine learning. It is a powerful tool for anyone looking to take control of their financial future.
